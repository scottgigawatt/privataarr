# Config Directory

Ahoy, matey! This be the config directory for Privateerr, yer trusty Docker Compose setup for Private Internet Access VPN connections with WireGuard.

## Purpose

This directory contains a default configuration file, [`wg0.conf`](./wg0.conf). When ye run Privateerr and weigh anchor, this file will be updated with the PIA WireGuard configuration.

## Instructions

To use this directory:

1. Run Privateerr and start the container.
2. Wait for the setup to complete and the [`wg0.conf`](./wg0.conf) file to be updated with the new configuration.
3. Find yer treasure map in this directory.

Ye can then use this file to configure a VPN client like Gluetun for secure connections.

Fair winds and following seas, me mateys! üåäüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
